    <h1>Ratatouille</h1>
    <p>One of the many reasons why I love ratatouille is because it is dish comprised of sliced tomatoes, eggplant, and squash suspended in a red-sauce.
        It is quite savory with a slight tangy bitterness that I enjoy. It also has the word 'rat' in it and <strong>rats are funky</strong>.
